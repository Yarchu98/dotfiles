# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, which I used for i3 in combination with rofi and picom. Please be aware of the fact that I don't use i3 anymore and therefore this repository hasn't been updated for a long time and I don't intend to do so for the time being and therefore can't help you in case of problems or difficulties.

## Installation

```bash 
cd home/.config && git clone https://github.com/alexschu98/dotfiles.git
``` 
**The directories should be set up correctly.**
