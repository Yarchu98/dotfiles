# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, which I used for i3 in combination with rofi and picom. Please be aware of the fact that I don't use i3 anymore and therefore this repository hasn't been updated for a long time and I don't intend to do so for the time being and therefore can't help you in case of problems or difficulties.

## Installation

Just clone the repository to your `home/config` folder. The directories should be set up correctly.
